# Todo

* Rename the "vars" function so it isn't masked by ggplot2.
* Add a README.md, along with a sample plot
* Clean up Packrat dependencies


## Features

* Penalize long assays
* Add transport steps


## Future possibilities

* Wrap the scheduler in an S4 or R6 class, providing an infrastructure for
writing other schedules.

* Allow the creation of arbitrary assays from a description alone.
